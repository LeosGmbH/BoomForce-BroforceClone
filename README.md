# BoomForce-BroforceClone
A recreation of Broforce, developed as a project for the Game Engines course of my  Software Engineering Bachelor studies. Built in Unity, the project emphasizes destructible environments, complex chain reactions, and physics-based object interactions, replicating the core gameplay mechanics of the original Game.
